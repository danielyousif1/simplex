# simplex
A feasibility solver that checks if a point in Euclidean space can be represented as a convex or conic combination. Implements Phase-I Simplex to find such coefficients.
In $\mathbb{R}^n$, he number of coefficients needed is at most $n+1$ and $n$, respectively. If interested, see Caratheodory's theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carath%C3%A9odory%27s_theorem_(convex_hull))
